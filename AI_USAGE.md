# AI Usage Documentation

## General Approach

This project was developed with AI assistance (Claude, via Cursor IDE). The AI was used primarily as a **sparring partner** in *Ask mode* to brainstorm concepts, validate design decisions, and discuss trade-offs. Implementation was done in *Agent mode* for individual, precisely scoped pieces of work — always directed by explicit instructions.

All architectural decisions, domain modeling, and error-handling strategies were made by me; the AI served as an accelerator, not a designer.

## Interaction Log

### 1 — README Structure

- **Mode:** Ask
- **Context:** Discussed what sections the project README should contain and how to structure it.
- **Outcome:** Defined README sections covering overview, design decisions, assumptions, error handling, and usage instructions.
